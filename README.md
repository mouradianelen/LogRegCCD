# Regularized Logistic Regression with Cyclic Coordinate Descent Parameter Estimation

The project implements cyclic coordinate descent algorithm to estimate parameters of regularized logistic regression. The implementation is based on [this](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v033i01) article.


## How to run

Clone the repository to your local machine with 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mouradianelen/LogRegCCD.git
```
To run this project you need Python and pip installed on your computer.
The project contains a requirements.txt, to install the necessary dependendencies run
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
The model and code for synthetic data generation are in files model and dataset which are imported into notebook.ipynb. 

To run the notebook you should choose a kernel for your Jupyter environment.

Each dataset is evaluated in a separate notebook.

Notes: Our code has been implemented using VSCode. It makes the installation and running process fairly easy.
